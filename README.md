# the-knowledge-used-in-graduate-report

This repository is used to record the techniques I have learnt during the graduation report.

Up till now, I have learnt how to use the **pyomo** and **gurobi** to construct and solve a optimized problem. 

Also, I learn how to use **nimare** to do the meta analysis to provide a prior knowledge for the future experiments.

And I learn to use many visualization techniques, including **nilearn**, **seaborn** and so on

I would keep updating it and add more details until I finished the graduation report.
