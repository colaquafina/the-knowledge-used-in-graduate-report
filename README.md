# the-knowledge-used-in-graduate-report

This repository is used to record the techniques I have learnt during the graduation report.

Up till now, I have learnt how to use the **pyomo** and gurobi to construct and solve a optimized problem. 

Also, I learn how to use **nimare** to do the meta analysis to provide a prior knowledge for the future experiments.

And I learn to use many visualization techniques, including nilearn, seaborn and so on

I would keep updating it and add more details until I finished the graduation report.
